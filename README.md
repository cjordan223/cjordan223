## Hi, I’m Conner

I’m a Security Engineer with a background in software engineering. I spend most of my time working on application security, internal tooling, and systems that have to hold up in real-world, security-conscious environments.

I learn best by building things, especially projects that let me explore how systems work behind the scenes.

### How I think about software

A lot of modern software is built quickly, iterated on constantly, and replaced just as fast. That pace can be exciting, but it also creates security and reliability challenges.

My work sits in that space: helping fast-moving systems stay secure, maintainable, and predictable even when visibility is limited and change is constant.

### What I work on
- Application and infrastructure security
- Vulnerability research and remediation
- Secure software design and threat modeling
- Internal security tooling and automation
- Web application development (frontend and backend)

### What I’m Working On Lately

**Zwicshen**  
An automated security tooling project I’m currently focused on, aimed at improving security analysis and operational workflows. This is an active, evolving project where I experiment with ideas around automation, usability, and security at scale.  
Repository: https://github.com/cjordan223/Zwicshen

Beyond this, I have a large collection of public repositories covering tooling, experiments, and side projects developed over time, reflecting a range of interests across web development and security.

### Work You Won’t See Here

**Coraline**  
A long-running solo application project representing 100's of hours of development work.

Coraline is a long-running full stack security application project built for the University of California that I’ve owned end to end since it's inception mid-2025. The code isn’t visible on this account as it lives in a separate organizational GitHub, but I’m always open to discussing the system architecture, security considerations, and lessons learned from building it.
